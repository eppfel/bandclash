        <p>A linked data application, in which two bands clash together in a heroic fight over their dominance in their greatness. Or you'd just say an online Band Go Fish.</p>
        <p>This project was created by <a href="http://felixpp.de">Felix Epp</a> and <a href="http://grahduerig.com/">Thomas Grah</a> for the course "Semantic Web" held by Prof. Bernhard Thull at <a href="http://h-da.de">Hochschule Darmstadt</a>. The task was to create a simple application, which makes use of linked open data concepts like RDF, SPARQL and OWL.
