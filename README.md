Bandclash Readme v0.9
=====================

Install
-------
We use the ARC framework for all local rdf operations. It is availible [here at Github](https://github.com/semsol/arc2).

To use our application you have to integrate it in one of the following ways:

*	Run this in your local repo folder: git clone https://github.com/semsol/arc2.git

*	Download it as [zip](https://github.com/semsol/arc2/zipball/master) and extract it into the 'arc2' folder

Description
-----------
A linked data application, in which two Bands clash together in a heroic fight over their dominance in their greatestness. Or you'd just say an online Band Go Fish.

Context
-------
This project is being created for the course "Semantic Web" held by Prof. Bernhard Thull at Hochschule Darmstadt by Felix Epp and Thomas Grah. The task is to create a simple application, which makes use of linked open data concepts like RDF, SPARQL and OWL.
